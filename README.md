# Degen Token (ERC-20): Unlocking the Future of Gaming

Deploy the `DegenToken` ERC-20 contract on Remix IDE, leveraging OpenZeppelin for functionalities like minting and burning tokens, then interact with the deployed contract on Avalanche Fuji Testnet for managing token rewards and transactions.

## Description

Deploy the DegenToken ERC-20 contract on Remix IDE using OpenZeppelin libraries for minting and burning tokens. Interact with the contract on Avalanche Fuji Testnet to facilitate token rewards and transactions within a gaming ecosystem, enhancing player engagement and utility.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

1. **Contract Development:**
   - Develop the `DegenToken` ERC-20 contract in Remix IDE, importing OpenZeppelin's `ERC20` and `Ownable` contracts.
   - Define functionalities for minting tokens only by the owner, burning tokens, and standard token transfers.

2. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the contract on Avalanche Fuji Testnet through Remix IDE, ensuring MetaMask is configured with sufficient test AVAX for gas fees.

3. **Interaction:**
   - Interact with the deployed contract via Remix IDE or MetaMask, minting tokens for rewards, facilitating token transfers, and burning tokens as needed.

4. **Validation:**
   - Verify contract deployment and functionality on Avalanche Fuji Testnet using transaction explorers like C-Chain Explorer to monitor transactions and token balances.
